Here we document the data types that have to be created or udpated with new fields: 

- meal/wizard
- bolus
- physical activity
- deviceEvent - Alarm 
- food
- deviceEvent - Zen mode
- deviceEvent - Private Mode
- security basal

_Note_: the examples below focused on the new fields. All the other fields (such as time, timezone, timezoneOffset) are not impacted by those changes and will not require updates.

## wizard 

The wizard object comes with an optional `recommended` structure that can be leveraged for our purpose. This structure is composed of 3 optional floating point value fields:
- carb: amount of insulin to cover the the total grams of carbohydrate input (`carbInput`)
- correction: amount of insulin recommended by the device to bring the PWD to their target blood glucose.
- net: total amount of recommended insulin

Here is an example of what can be sent with the related meaning:
- `recommended.net` is the system recommendation
- `bolus.normal` is the value delivered by the insulin pump.
- `bolus.expectedNormal` is the original value that has been requested to the insulin pump.
- `bolus.prescriptor` is a new field that describes the origin of the bolus. Details are defined in the below food section. 

And the additional field we would need:
- `inputTime` is a UTC string timestamp that defines at what time the patient has entered the meal. This field is optional. It takes the same format as `time` field.
- `inputMeal` is a structure describing the meal
  - `inputMeal.meal`: type of meal as defined on the handset, `small | medium | large`. This field is optional.
  - `inputMeal.snack`: is is defined as a snack by the user on the handset, `yes | no`. This field is optional.
  - `inputMeal.fat`: is is defined as a fat meal by the user on the handset, `yes | no`. This field is optional.

  }
}
```

## food 

As of now we don't have the information of the origin of the rescueCarbs value, is it a patient decision, is it a system recommendation, and in that case what was the recommendation vs the actual value.

Here we are introducing 2 new fields in the food object:
- `prescribedNutrition`: same structure as nutrition. It's an optional field. It gives the value that has been recommended by the system. 
- `prescriptor`: is the origin of the `rescuecarbs` object. This field is mandatory in one case, `hybrid`: 
    - range of values: `auto | manual | hybrid`
    - `auto`: prescribedNutrition is ignored
    - `manual`: prescribedNutrition is ignored
    - `hybrid`: nutrition and prescribedNutrition are __not equal__, `prescribedNutrition` is mandatory in that case. 

```json
{
  "type": "food",
  "meal": "rescuecarbs",
  "nutrition": {
    "carbohydrate" : {
      "net": 20,
      "units": "grams"
    }
  },
  "prescribedNutrition": {
    "carbohydrate" : {
      "net": 30,
      "units": "grams"
    }
  },
  "prescriptor": "hybrid",
  "deviceId": "IdOfTheDevice",
  "deviceTime": "2020-05-12T06:50:08",
  "time": "2020-05-12T06:50:08.000Z",
  "timezoneOffset": 120
}

```

## bolus

3 types of bolus events are available as of now in the system:
- normal
- square
- dual/square

Here we are introducing 2 new fields in the bolus objects:
- `prescriptor`: same as above in `food`. This field is optional. 
- `insulinOnBoard`: amount of active insulin estimated by the system. This field will be accepted when `prescriptor` is either `auto` or `hybrid`. It will be ignored for `manual` entries.

```json
{
  "time": "2020-05-12T08:50:08.000Z",
  "timezone": "Europe/Paris",
  "deviceTime": "2020-05-12T08:50:08",
  "deviceId": "IdOfTheDevice",
  "type": "bolus",
  "subType": "normal",
  "normal": 3.5,
  "expectedNormal": 4.0, 
  "prescriptor": "hybrid"
}
```

## biphasic bolus

A `biphasic` bolus is a 2 parts bolus that is defined by the system. Below is the definition for this new type of bolus that leverages most of the fields from `normal` bolus. The subType associated to this type of bolus is `biphasic`.
We add the following fields:
- `eventId`: unique ID provided by the client that is used to link the 2 parts of the bolus. This field is mandatory. 
- part: `"1" | "2"`. It's either the first part or the second part of the bolus. This field is mandatory. 
- `normal` and `expectedNormal` are similar to what is defined in `normal` bolus. 
- `linkedBolus` defined the second part of the bolus at the time the first part is created. It's an estimated bolus that may be modified by the system. This section is optional. 
  - `linkedBolus.normal`: the expected value for the second part of the biphasic bolus. The actual value is provided by the `"part":"2"` object.
  - `linkedBolus.duration`: the expected duration between the first and the second part of the biphasic bolus. The actual duration is provided by the `"part":"2"` object through the effective time of this second object. The duration structure is leveraged from structure already used in other objects such as physical activity.
- `prescriptor`: same as above in `food`. This field is optional. 

__Note #1__: this type of bolus can be used in the wizard object the same way we use the `normal` bolus.

__Note #2__: the `"part":"2"` object is not mandatory. The system can decide to cancel this second part of the bolus. 

```json
{
  "time": "2020-05-12T12:00:00.000Z",
  "timezone": "Europe/Paris",
  "deviceTime": "2020-05-12T12:00:08",
  "deviceId": "IdOfTheDevice",
  "type": "bolus",
  "subType": "biphasic",
  "eventId": "Bo123456789",
  "part": "1",
  "normal": 3.5,
  "expectedNormal": 4.0,
  "linkedBolus": {
    "normal": 3.5,
    "duration": {
    	  "value": 60,
    	  "units": "minutes"
    }
  },
  "prescriptor": "auto"
}
{
  "time": "2020-05-12T12:50:00.000Z",
  "timezone": "Europe/Paris",
  "deviceTime": "2020-05-12T12:50:08",
  "deviceId": "IdOfTheDevice",
  "type": "bolus",
  "subType": "biphasic",
  "eventId": "Bo123456789",
  "part": "2",
  "normal": 3.5,
  "prescriptor": "auto"
}
```

## Pen bolus

A `pen` bolus is a normal bolus administered manually with insulin pen or syringe. The subType associated to this type of bolus is `pen`. This new structure is based on the `Bolus` object with an additional field: 
- `normal` is similar to what is defined in `normal` bolus. 

```json
{
  "time": "2020-05-12T12:00:00.000Z",
  "timezone": "Europe/Paris",
  "deviceTime": "2020-05-12T12:00:08",
  "deviceId": "IdOfTheDevice",
  "type": "bolus",
  "subType": "pen",
  "normal": 5
}
```

## physical activity

We need additional fields to get the time at which the physical activity is created, and the last time it was updated by the patient:
- `inputTime` is a UTC string timestamp that defines at what time the patient has entered or modified the physical activity. This field is optional. It takes the same format as `time` field.
- `eventId`: unique ID provided by the client that is used to link stop and start events. If we receive several objects with the same ID, the most recent one will be the effective one while the other objects will be considered as history of changes. The duration is __mandatory__ when this field is provided.

In the below example, The 2 objects are sent in 2 separate requests. The first object coming with the first request indicates that the physical activity is entered on the handset at 8:00am. It starts at 8:50am for 60 minutes. The second object that is received later on as part of a second request says that the duration of the same activity has been changed to 50 minutes. This last information was entered at 10:00am. This second object will become the effective one while first one can be considered as the history of changes. The link between both is done through the common `eventId`. 

```json
{
    "type": "physicalActivity",
    "reportedIntensity": "medium",
    "duration": { 
    	"value": 60,
    	"units": "minutes"
    },
    "eventId": "AP123456789",
    "deviceId": "DBLG1.1.6",
    "deviceTime": "2016-07-12T23:52:47",
    "inputTime": "2020-05-12T08:00:08.000Z",
    "time": "2020-05-12T08:50:08.000Z",
    "timezoneOffset": 60
}

{
    "type": "physicalActivity",
    "reportedIntensity": "medium",
    "duration": { 
    	"value": 50,
    	"units": "minutes"
    },
    "eventId": "AP123456789",
    "deviceId": "DBLG1.1.6",
    "deviceTime": "2016-07-12T23:52:47",
    "inputTime": "2020-05-12T10:00:08.000Z",
    "time": "2020-05-12T08:50:08.000Z",
    "timezoneOffset": 60
}
```

## Alarm events
Leveraging the `deviceEvent` type with the already defined `alarm` subType. We add couple of fields to get more details on alarms and acknowledgement. 

The below fields are mandatory if `alarmType` is set to `handset`. They remain optional for any other values.
- `eventId`: unique Id of the event generated by the client system. This ID will be used to reconciliate data for the same event. _Maximum length is 64 characters_.
- `alarmLevel`: `alarm | alert`.  
- `alarmCode`: code of the alarm.  _Maximum length is 64 characters_. 
- `alarmLabel`: label or description of the alarm. _Maximum length is 256 characters_.
- `ackStatus`: this fields gives the acknowledge status of the alarm that can take one of the following values `new | acknowledged | outdated`. 
- `updateTime`: this timestamp gives the last time the alarm was updated. It takes the same format as `time` field.

```json
{
  "type": "deviceEvent",
  "subType": "alarm",
  "alarmType": "handset",
  "eventId": "123456789",
  "alarmLevel": "alarm", 
  "alarmCode": "123456",
  "alarmLabel": "Label of the alarm",
  "ackStatus": "acknowledged",
  "updateTime": "2020-05-12T08:51:08.000Z",
  "deviceId": "Id12345",
  "deviceTime": "2018-02-01T00:00:00",
  "time": "2020-05-12T08:50:08.000Z",
  "timezoneOffset": 60
}
```

## Zen mode , Confidential mode && Sensor Warmup

Leveraging the `deviceEvent` type and creating 2 new subTypes with the same structure: `zen` and `confidential`.

- `subType`: `zen | confidential | warmup`
- `duration`: is a structured object that gives the duration of the event. __This field is mandatory__.
- `eventId`: unique ID provided by the client that is used to link stop and start events. __This ID is mandatory__.
- `inputTime`: is a UTC string timestamp that defines at what time the patient has entered or modified the event. __This field is manadatory__. It takes the same format as `time` field.

```json
{
  "type": "deviceEvent",
  "subType": "zen",
  "eventId": "Zen123456789",
  "duration": { 
    "value": 3,
    "units": "hours"
  },
  "deviceId": "Id12345",

  "time": "2020-05-12T08:50:08.000Z",
  "inputTime": "2020-05-12T08:40:00.000Z",
  "timezone": "Europe/Paris"
}
{
  "type": "deviceEvent",

  "duration": { 
    "value": 3,
    "units": "hours"
  },
  "deviceId": "Id12345",

  "time": "2020-05-12T08:50:08.000Z",
  "inputTime": "2020-05-12T08:40:00.000Z",
  "timezone": "Europe/Paris"
}
```

## security basal

The basal is defined as an array of scheduled basals over the day defined at a given `time`. The array contains all the values to describe the scheduled basals, `basalSchedule:
- rate: a floating point number >= 0 representing the amount of insulin delivered in units per hour.
- start: an integer encoding a start time as milliseconds from the start of a twenty-four hour day.

The objects in the basalSchedule array have to be sorted based on the `start` field. If the objects are not correctly sorted, the API will return for the given entry that is not well positionned.

Below is an example of a valid basal with 4 segments in the day:
- 12am to 12pm: 1 u/hour
- 12pm to 6pm: 0.8 u/hour
- 6pm to 9pm: 1.2 u/hour
- 9pm to 12am: 0.5 u/hour

```json
{
  "type": "basalSecurity",
  "deviceTime": "2018-02-01T00:00:00",
  "time": "2020-05-12T08:50:08.000Z",
  "timezone": "Europe/Paris",
  "basalSchedule": [
    {"rate": 1, "start": 0 },
    {"rate": 0.8, "start": 43200000 },
    {"rate": 1.2, "start": 64800000 },
    {"rate": 0.5, "start": 75600000 }
    ]
  }
```
